#1 create five (5) variables withn the values 30, GOOD, 100, GREEN, ans NIGERIA
#2 name the variables with: number, status, century, colour, and counytry respectively

number<- 30
status<- 'GOOD'
century<- 100
colour<- 'GREEN'
country<- "NIGERIA"
#3 types of data
#30 - number data
#status - character data
#century - number data
#colour - character data
#country - character data

# great work for the first 14 lines, the only obsevation is the number data type as you mention is called numeric data type 


#4 create five(5) numerical variables with the value 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250
#5 assign a variable name a-e for the five(5) variables respectively
#6 perform the following operations on the above variable: addition, substraction , multiplication and division)
#7 perfomr the following operation between variable A and B, (<, >, ==, %/%, %%, !=)

a<- 50
b<- 100
c<- 150
d<- 200
e<- 250

add<- a + b
add

add<- a + b + c 
add
 sub<- e - b 
sub 

mult<- b * c
mult

divide<- c / a
divide

a<b
a>b
a==b
a%/%b
a%%b
a!=b

#All the line of codes from 24 - 29 are correct, the only thing i expect is you comment/answer each line 

#8 create three(3) character variables: is a country, in Africa, Nigeria
#name the country as: where, continent, country
#write a code thatb return "Nigeria is a country in Africa

where<- "is a country"
continent<- "in Africa"
country<- "Nigeria"

paste("Nigeria", "is a counttry", "in Africa")

#the last line of code is incorrect, you write the variable name so it can return the variable,,, you suppose to paste where, continent and country
